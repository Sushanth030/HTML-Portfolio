<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hey there, I’m Sushanth, a passionate web developer on a journey through code and creativity.
   Originally from Hyderabad, India,
    my roots trace back to where I first discovered my love for technology during my schooling days.</p>

<p>Driven by an insatiable curiosity, 
  I embarked on an incredible adventure, 
  crossing continents to the USA to pursue my Masters, 
  a pivotal moment where I honed my skills and deepened my understanding of computer technology. 
  Yet, that hunger for learning never fades;
   it’s a constant companion in my quest to stay at the forefront of this dynamic field.</p>

   crafting resonating digital experiences.
